# skHype Stickers

**Testing project:** giving [Element](https://element.io) nostalgic Skype feels with a customized Sticker Picker (thanks to [Maunium Sticker Picker](https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker)).

Early testâ€”just hacking ideas together and seeing what works!
After the announcement of Skype shutting down, it seemed fitting to bring back some of those good ol' emotes somewhere.

ðŸ§ª Still building and figuring things out on the fly!
